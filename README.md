Codes for Background inplementations Xamarin Forms

Hello Guys!
I am working on implementing beautiful backgrounds and templetes for different Apps I develop. I am sharing this with you here. Use it as you wish!
While learning Xamarin Forms, developing and sharing these code snipets with Gif examples makes me excited to learn more.
Enjoy the code and hopefully it helps you!

This code consists of basically two parts. The Background is at First a line gradiant that is scaled to 4 times so It changes in the view by the changing of positions from the Gradient generated. There are four movements, up, down, left, and right.

The second part is the two shapes added, png images, that have very slow Rotation, Fadind, and Scale animations do achieve this effect. They are placed on a grid and the grid Vertical Option is modified so that the two images sit on the Start and End of the Page.

Here is a preview of what it looks like:
